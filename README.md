# OrientationControl
This project proposes a force-based task-orientation controller to online deal with uncertain interaction tasks. A gradient descent-based orientation controller is proposed, enhancing its performance with orientation predictions provided by a Gaussian Process modeling.

# Gradient descent orientation control (high frequency)


# GP-based orientation control (low frequency)
